Kattis\\Above Average
=====================

Description
-----------

It is said that `90%` of frosh expect to be above average in their class. You are to provide a reality check.

Input
-----

The first line of standard input contains an integer `1 ≤ C ≤ 50`, the number of test cases. `C` data sets follow. Each data set begins with an integer, `N`, the number of people in the class (`1 ≤ N ≤ 1000`). `N` integers follow, separated by spaces or newlines, each giving the final grade (an integer between `0` and `100`) of a student in the class.

Output
------

For each case you are to output a line giving the percentage of students whose grade is above average, rounded to exactly `3` decimal places.
